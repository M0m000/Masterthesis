CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findpy_trees.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "py_trees",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "py_trees" with any
  of the following names:

    py_treesConfig.cmake
    py_trees-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "py_trees" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "py_trees_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "py_trees" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
